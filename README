WDB DATA VISUALIZER
===================

This is a very simple program to visualize gridded data in a wdb
database, mostly for verifying that database contents are resonably
sane. 

When connected to a database, it will fetch all grid rows (but not the
grids themselves) from the database. Therefore it is not recomended to
use this program on huge databases.


Building
--------

Qt4 is required for building this program. You can do it this way:

$ qmake && make
